// Hey there, Welcome to this Algorithm and Data structure repository

// Questions here are from Leetcode sorted from easy to hard (beginner to advanced)

// This is a step by step, question to question, text exercise for me and tutorial for you (if you're just starting out like I am), on how to go about solving these questions

// Some of the solutions may not be optimized while some are

// I will indicate which of the solutions are not optimized

// Feel free to make changes if you have an optimized code and create a PR (pull req)

// I will run, learn and merge your algorithms from the changes you made

// If they are optimal than the prior solution your PR will be merged

// Else, we could analyze your solution and try to make it optimal

// It's more of an exercise for anyone interested in participating

// Doesn't matter if the ques and solutions are more than months old (Hopefully it won't take me that much time to have optimize non-efficient algos) 

// Feel free to engage

// Thank you for being here!!!
